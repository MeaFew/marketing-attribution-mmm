## Overview

This system is built on the figshare "Conjura Multi-Region MMM Dataset" (covering ~100 e-commerce brands, 19 territories, 132,759 daily records from 2019–2024) and delivers a complete analytical pipeline from **macro Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM)** to **micro user journey attribution** to **budget-constrained optimization**.

Core business problems addressed:

- **Channel ROI quantification**: When multiple channels run simultaneously, how do you isolate each channel's true contribution to conversions?
- **Attribution model selection**: First-touch, Last-touch, Shapley Value, and Removal Effect analysis yield vastly different conclusions — how do you systematically compare them?
- **Budget allocation by intuition**: Under a fixed total budget, how do you scientifically reallocate channel spend to maximize revenue?

| Layer | Technology | Rationale |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| Data Cleaning | **Polars** | Vectorized execution + lazy evaluation; processes 132K rows in milliseconds |
| Storage | Parquet | Columnar compression, efficient read/write |
| Macro Modeling | **statsmodels** + **scikit-learn** | OLS provides full statistical inference (p-values, confidence intervals); Ridge/Lasso handles channel collinearity |
| Micro Attribution | 6 self-built models | Covers rule-based (First/Last/Linear/Time-decay) and game-theoretic (Shapley/Removal Effect) approaches for head-to-head comparison |
| Budget Optimization | **scipy.optimize** SLSQP | Supports equality constraints (fixed total budget) and inequality constraints (per-channel floor); stable convergence |
| Delivery | **Streamlit** + **Plotly** | Three-page interactive dashboard: MMM Overview / Attribution Comparison / Budget Simulator |

## Core Modules

### 1. Data Preprocessing (`scripts/preprocess.py`)

```
Input:  132,759 rows x 50 cols (heavy nulls + thousand-separator commas)
Output: Cleaned Parquet (daily granularity)
Key operations:
  - Thousand-separator removal + Float64 coercion (fixes Polars auto-inferring String)
  - CTR, CPM, ROAS derived metric calculation
  - Adstock decay feature construction: x_t + 0.5*x_{t-1} + 0.25*x_{t-3} + 0.125*x_{t-7}
  - Temporal feature extraction (year/month/day_of_week/is_weekend)
```

### 2. Marketing Mix Modeling (`scripts/mmm_model.py`)

| Model | R^2 | Adj. R^2 | Best Regularization |
|-------|-----|---------|---------------------|
| OLS | 0.569 | 0.563 | — |
| **Ridge** | 0.569 | 0.563 | alpha = 1.0 |
| Lasso | 0.569 | 0.563 | alpha = 0.1 |

> R^2 ~ 0.57 reflects the typical challenge of cross-brand aggregate MMM: without price/promotion/competitor data, using only channel spend to explain revenue variance hits a natural ceiling. Brand-level MMM with richer features can achieve 0.70–0.85.

### 3. Multi-Touch Attribution (`scripts/multi_touch_attribution.py`)

Uses the real **Criteo Attribution Modeling for Bidding Dataset** (30 days of live traffic, 16.5M impressions, 6.1M users, 45K conversions). Impression-level data is aggregated by `uid` into user journeys. The Top 10 campaigns are kept as individual channels; the remaining 665 campaigns are grouped into an `other` bucket. Five attribution models plus removal effect analysis are compared:

| Channel | First-Touch | Last-Touch | Linear | Time-Decay | **Shapley** | **Removal Eff.** |
|---------|:-----------:|:----------:|:------:|:----------:|:-----------:|:----------:|
| campaign_10341182 | 4.2% | 5.1% | 4.2% | 5.0% | **4.2%** | **16.9%** |
| campaign_9100693 | 3.2% | 4.7% | 5.3% | 4.4% | **3.3%** | **19.4%** |
| campaign_15184511 | 3.3% | 3.2% | 2.7% | 3.2% | **3.2%** | **16.1%** |
| campaign_30801593 | 3.0% | 3.0% | 3.2% | 2.9% | **2.9%** | **1.1%** |
| campaign_32368244 | 2.4% | 2.9% | 2.4% | 2.8% | **2.4%** | **13.3%** |
| campaign_15398570 | 2.2% | 2.2% | 1.7% | 2.2% | **2.3%** | **5.8%** |
| campaign_29427842 | 1.6% | 1.7% | 1.6% | 1.7% | **1.9%** | **6.5%** |
| campaign_2869134 | 1.9% | 2.9% | 3.5% | 2.7% | **1.9%** | **12.0%** |
| campaign_31772643 | 1.2% | 1.1% | 0.8% | 1.1% | **1.3%** | **5.4%** |
| campaign_28351001 | 1.3% | 1.1% | 0.8% | 1.1% | **1.3%** | **3.5%** |
| **other** | **75.7%** | **72.0%** | **73.7%** | **73.0%** | **75.5%** | **0.0%** |

> Note: Campaign IDs are anonymized Criteo campaign IDs. `other` aggregates the 665 long-tail campaigns outside the Top 10, so it dominates impressions and conversions.

**Key Findings:**

- **Rule-based models (First/Last/Linear/Time-Decay)** are highly consistent on real data: because the `other` bucket covers the vast majority of impressions, all rule-based models assign it 72%–76% of attribution credit.
- **Shapley Value** still provides the most stable allocation on real data. The Top 3 channels (campaign_10341182, campaign_9100693, campaign_15184511) contribute ~11% combined, consistent with rule-based models.
- **Removal Effect** is insensitive to the `other` bucket (removing `other` leaves almost no sample, driving its share to 0%), but it is highly sensitive to individual top campaigns — campaign_9100693 and campaign_10341182 show removal effects of 19.4% and 16.9%, respectively, indicating they have the largest marginal impact on overall conversion rate.
- **Methodological insight**: On real data, differences between attribution models are smaller than on simulated data (because the `other` bucket dominates), but Shapley and Removal Effect still effectively identify the highest-impact campaigns.

### 4. Budget Optimization (`scripts/budget_optimizer.py`)

Using Ridge MMM coefficients and intercept as a linear response function, SLSQP solves for optimal allocation under a fixed total budget:

| Scenario | Total Budget | Predicted Revenue | Uplift |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|--------|
| Current Allocation (Baseline) | 100% | Baseline | — |
| **Re-optimized Allocation** | 100% | **+132.2%** | Same total budget, reallocated proportions only |
| Budget +10% + optimization | 110% | +133.6% | Incremental budget prioritized to high-ROI channels |
| Budget +20% + optimization | 120% | +134.9% | Diminishing marginal returns begin to emerge |

> **Business Insight**: Without increasing total budget, data-driven reallocation alone can double revenue — especially critical for budget-constrained mid-size brands.

## Limitations & Production Path

| Limitation | Current Approach | Production Path |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Multi-touch attribution uses real Criteo data, but campaigns are aggregated | Top 10 campaigns + `other` bucket (665 campaigns) to keep Shapley computation tractable | Integrate directly with CDP/Segment/Tealium for complete, unaggregated user journeys; or use more compute to handle all campaigns |
| MMM is daily granularity | Original daily data provides reasonable temporal resolution | Introduce hour-of-day or daypart features for further refinement |
| No competitive environment variables | Model assumes constant market share | Incorporate competitor spend data (e.g., Pathmatics, Sensor Tower) |
| Single-node execution | Local Parquet | Migrate to Snowflake/BigQuery + dbt pipeline orchestration |
| Budget optimization is static | One-time solve, no dynamic budget adjustment | Reinforcement learning (PPO / MADDPG) for real-time budget bidding |
